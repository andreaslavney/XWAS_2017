Notes on conducting X chromosome-wide association studies using the Keinan lab's XWAS 1.1 package
(http://keinanlab.cb.bscb.cornell.edu/content/xwas-v11)

XWAS (chromosome X-Wide Analysis toolSet) is a software suite for the analysis of the X chromosome in association analyses and similar studies, built on plink v1.07. It includes X-specific QC functions and statistical tests that improve power to detect associations compared to methods that treat the X chromosome as an autosome.

The X chromosome has often been excluded from GWAS, which means that in many older data sets it was not analyzed before publication. As a result, X chromosome data sometimes requires additional preprocessing before it can be successfully be run through plink or XWAS.
